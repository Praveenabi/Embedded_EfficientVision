## Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)
- CNNs have emerged as the predominant approach for computer vision tasks due to their natural inductive locality biases and translation equivalence.
- However, the extensive computation of standard CNNs renders them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
- Many efficient design principles have been proposed to enhance the computational efficiency of CNNs for mobile devices. Lightweight CNN Design Principles are 
    - **Separable Convolutions**(MobileNets)
    - **Inverted Residual Bottlenecks**(MobileNetV2)
    - **Channel Shuffling**(ShuffleNet, ShuffleNetv2)
    - **Structural Re-parameterization**(RepVGG, ACNet)

## Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- ViT adapts the transformer architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale image recognition tasks, surpassing that of CNNs.
- Building on the competitive performance of ViTs, subsequent works have sought to incorporate spatial inductive biases to enhance their stability and performance(CoatNet, CMT), design more efficient self-attention operations (CSwin Transformer, Biformer), and adapt ViTs to a diverse range of computer vision tasks.
-  Heavy-weighted, requiring substantial computation and memory footprint [39, 58]. That makes them unsuitable for mobile devices with limited resources.
-  Many efficient design principles have been proposed to enhance the computational efficiency of ViTs for mobile devices. Lightweight ViT Design Principles are
    - **Hybrid Networks**(MobileFormer,MobileViT)
    - **Self Attention with Linear Complexity**(MobileViTv2)
    - **Dimension Consistent Design Principles**(EfficientFormer,EfficientFormerv2)

## Differences Between Lightweight ViTs and CNNs
- **Block Structure, Macro/Micro Designs**
- **Block Structure - MetaFormer (ViTs), Inverted Residual Bottleneck (CNNs)**

## Block Design
- **Separate token mixer and channel mixer**
    - The block structure of lightweight ViTs(EfficientFormerV2, EfficientFomer,MobileViTV2) incorporates an important design feature, namely the separate token mixer and channel mixer.
    - According to the recent research, the effectiveness of ViTs primarily originates
    from their general token mixer and channel mixer architecture, i.e., the MetaFormer architecture, rather than the equipped specific token mixer.
    - [MetaFormer Baselines for Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13452)
    - [MetaFormer Is Actually What You Need for Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11418)
- **Reducing Expansion Ratio and increasing width**
    -  In vanilla ViTs, the expansion ratio in the channel mixer is typically set to 4, making the hidden dimension of the Feed Forward Network (FFN) module 4Ã— wider than the input dimension.
    -  It thus consumes a significant portion of the computation resource, thereby contributing substantially to the overall inference time(explained in SaViT).
    -  To alleviate this bottle neck, recent works(LV-ViT,LeViT) employ a narrower FFN.
    - NViT  point out that there exists a significant amount of channel redundancy in FFN. Therefore, it is reasonable to use a smaller expansion ratio.
    - Consequently, with the smaller expansion ratio, we can increase the network width to remedy the large parameter reduction. 
    - We double the channels after each stage, ending up with 48, 96, 192, and 384 channels for each stage, respectively

## Macro Design
- **Stem**
    - Early Convolution
- **Downsampling Layers**
    - Deeper Downsampling Layers
- **Classifier**
    - simple classifier - a global average pooling layer and a linear layer
- **Overall Stage ratio**
    - Stage ratio represents the ratio of the number of blocks in different stages, thereby indicating the distribution of computation across the stages.
    - we employ a stage ratio of 1:1:7:1 for the network
    - We then increase the network depth to 2:2:14:2, achieving a deeper layout

## Micro Design
- **Kernel Size Selection**
    - [**ConvNext](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03545), [**RePLKNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06717), employs Large kernel-sized convolution, exhibiting the performance gain.
    - However, large kernel-sized convolution is not friendly for mobile devices, due to its computation complexity and memory access costs
    - To ensure the inference efficiency on the mobile device, we prioritize the simple 3 Ã— 3 convolutions
- **SE Layer Placement**
    - Advantage of self-attention module compared with convolution is the ability to adapt weights according to input, known as the data-driven attribute
        - [Spatial Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02025)
        - [CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06521)
    - As a channel wise attention module, SE layers can compensate for the limitation of convolutions in lacking data-driven attributes, bringing better performance
        - [Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507)
        - [ParC-Net: Position Aware Circular Convolution with Merits from ConvNets and Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03952)
    - However, as shown in TresNet, stages with low-resolution feature maps get a smaller accuracy benefit, compared to stages with higher resolution feature maps.
        - [TResNet: High Performance GPU-Dedicated Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13630)
    - Meanwhile, along with performance gains, SE layers also introduce non-negligible computational costs
    - Therefore, we design a strategy to utilize SE layers in a cross-block manner, i.e., adopting the SE layer in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... block in each stage, to maximize the accuracy benefit with a minimal latency increment
